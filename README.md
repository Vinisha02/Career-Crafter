# Career-Crafter
 Career Crafter provides seven unique resume templates for different job fields. It's an easy-to-use tool to help people make impressive resumes quickly and effectively.
 
# What all it includes
This project has seven different templates which were
1. Job/Internship
2. Scholarship Application
3. Fellowship or Research Program Application
4.  Artistic or Creative Position Resume
5. Applying for College/University Resume
6. Mass Media/Journalism Resume
7. Film Making/Entertainment Industry Resume

-->> In our project, we utilized the concept of header files to streamline the integration process. We created separate .cpp files for each resume template and corresponding header files. Additionally, we developed a main2_4.cpp file that consolidates all these templates.

When a user interacts with this program, they are presented with a choice to select a specific resume template based on the job role they are targeting. Using the command prompt, users can navigate through the options, input their data, and customize the template accordingly.

Upon completion, the user is prompted to choose a name for their resume. The program then saves the customized resume as a properly formatted file. We have included seven template files as examples, demonstrating the appearance of resumes created using these .cpp files, those file names are temp1, temp2, temp3.. etc.

# How to run the code
